## Ra# Programming Language
RadianceOS introduces Ra#, a programming language based on C#. Explore the [documentation](https://github.com/SzymekkYT/RadianceOS/blob/main/RaSharp.md) to unleash the full potential of Ra# in your projects!

## Security Manager
An easy to use and straight forward app for managing the Security of your RadianceOS instance. It can interact with the Security background tasks that manage the permissions of all of the other apps and functions.
UAC comes as part of this, which stands for **U**ser **A**ccess **C**ontrol. This is a little popup that you'll get occationally asking you if you want to give an app permission, or asking for an admin password to be able to give the current user administrative permissions.<br>
